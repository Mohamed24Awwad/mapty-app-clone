# Mapty


The main part of this application is a huge map,When you load the application for the first time the browser will ask you if it is allowed to know your location. If you allow,JavaScript will automatically fetch and load the map on your current position,Now the goal of this application is to log workouts

You need to click position on the map where you had a workout before, Then on the left side will appear a special form with several fields, Here need to choose an option running or cycling fill distance field, time etc. After filling the form, press enter and the form will be replaced with a workout list.

When you have several workout popups on the left sidebar you can press one of them and the map will move to that workout position.

This application was created by learning JavaScript from Jonas Schmedtmann
